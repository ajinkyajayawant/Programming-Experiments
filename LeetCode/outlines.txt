# 2
## Method
Algorithm wise seems a straightforward problem.
Brute force: compute the sum by traversing the linked lists simultaneously
## Decomposition of functions
## Questions
- How to create a new list
- How to traverse lists simultaneously
- What does the colon notation mean
- How to detect end of list?
- What was the data structure Optional? I didn't understand

# 6
## Method
Have lists for different rows. Process the string character by character and doing an operation like modulo, fill in the lists.
## Questions
- How to create(in one shot) a dictionary with keys given by indices?
- How to iterate a string?

# 15
## Method
- Basic iteration by recursively solving. Hold one index and pass the rest of the array for another criteria.

# 16
## Method
- Similar to problem 15

# 17
## Questions
- When strings are spliced do we create new strings or are they part of the original string?

# 19
- After writing individual functions for the list length, getting the 2nd node after, it is easy to remove the node in-place or create another list.
## Questions
- To pass reference to a node in the list, we should just return that object? Or is there any different syntax?

# 347
## Questions
- Is there any built in frequency counter function in python?

# 437
## Method
- Can be solved in a recursive way

# 1504
Didn't get this. Didn't get even after two hints. Didn't have a clue what category/type of problem it is.

# 1535
- Seems just like a simulation

# 1802
Tough for me in the first attempt.
## Method
- On thinking again seems more like a math problem than a programming problem.
