Sometimes when I add a file like LICENSE to github repository I need to update it with the local repository. To do that I do 'git fetch origin', then I do 'git merge origin/master' and 'git push -u origin master'.
To view all commits do 'git log'.

Git branch details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Create a new branch: git branch <new branch name>
git branch -av

Resolve merge conflict: Simple way is to edit the file yourself to remove the conflicts.

Git stashing working directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Git stash basically stores all changes since a commit in a buffer and returns a clean working directory.
Create a named stash using - git stash save "<stash name>"
Create a named stash using (saves untracked files too) - git stash -u "<stash name>"
List all stashes - git stash list
Check details on a stash - git stash show stash@{0}
To apply a stash to the current working directory - git stash apply stash@{0}
Drop a stash - git stash drop stash@{0}
Pop a stash(Convenient because you don't have to remember whether you used a stash or not) - git stash pop stash@{0}
Drop all stashes - git stash clear
To discard unstaged changes the cleanest way I have found is to stash them and then drop the stash.

Git get a file from a particular Hash - git show <HASH>:/path/to/file > <file_destination>
Git push a local branch to the repo: git push -u origin <branchname>

Git file status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
git status --ignored
git ls-files --others --ignored --exclude-standard
git ls-files --cached
(Use this command with caution as it will overwrite local modified by unstaged file) Checkout a file from an old commit(In case you deleted by mistake or don't want to current one): git checkout <HASH> -- <filepath>

Git and file permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Discarding changes in file permissions/mode or executable :
Config ONLY for current repo:
git config core.filemode false

Config globally:
git config --global core.filemode false

Add in ~/.gitconfig:
[core]
filemode = false

Git deleting branches locally when you mess it up
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
git branch -d <local_branch>
To delete a branch from the online repository: git push <remote> --delete <branch>

Git stop tracking files but don't delete from local tree:
git rm --cached
git rm --cached -r ./
(May need to update index after this)
Unstage staged file: git reset HEAD <filename>
Visualize git branches: gitk --all
Compare two branches git: git diff <branch1>..<branch2>

Git delete untracked files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
git clean -n
git clean

Git commits to different branches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Get the code from the remote branch - git fetch
Merge the code locally with my current commit - git pull

Merge a branch into another: git merge --no-ff <name of branch to merge>

Git comparing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To list the SHA HASHES of commits - git log
To compare with previous commit - git diff HEAD^ HEAD
To list the files in a commit - git ls-tree --name-only -r <SHA_HASH>
List the differences between the commits - git diff --stat <SHA_HASH1> <SHA_HASH2>
Show the files which changed between the commits - git diff --name-only <SHA_HASH1> <SHA_HASH2>
Show the files which changed between the commits along with short summary about change in file status - git diff --name-status <SHA_HASH1> <SHA_HASH2>
If a good visual utility like meld is available do git difftool instead of git diff
git diff HEAD shows the difference with the last commit
To see the commits in which a file has changed: git log --follow -- <filename>
Comparing directories is also possible using meld.
Otherwise for comparing directories either do:
diff -r dir1 dir2
or
diff -qr dir1 dir2
If the differences are hard to read, use
diff -r dir1 dir2 | sort

git index
~~~~~~~~~
Git index actually contains all files tracked - staged and committed.
Ref 1 - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3516823/whats-the-difference-between-the-index-cached-and-staged-in-git/47543410#47543410
Ref 2 (See QA) - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1587846/how-do-i-show-the-changes-which-have-been-staged

Git diff explanation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The symbols --- and +++ represent what is used to describe the file.
@@ represents chunks.
-1,2 +1 means line one and two were changed in the first file and line one was changed in the second file.

Move and Copy
-------------
Options for rsync
--remove-source-files -> moves the files from source to directory
--progress -> shows progress
-h -> Human readable
-v -> verbose
Never use --delete and --remove-source-files at the same time
rsync is slower than cp and mv for simple operations. But it excels when stability is needed or just some incremental copy is needed or there are a lot of files which mv cannot handle that fast.
For deleting empty directories in the source directory use
find . -depth -type d -empty -delete
Possible alternative to rsync
mv -uv, -u -> Update
mv only changes the address whereas rsync actually copies the files to the new destination.
There is no easy way to recursively sync directories other than rsync.
cp -nvr -> Nice recursive copy without copying already existing files
mv cannot do recursive merging, one point to keep in mind.
cp cannot delete files from source directory.
So if there is enough space to create a copy then just use cp and delete the source files, otherwise need to use the slower rsync and then delete the empty directories. rsync only copies/sends differences of files.
mv -v is a convenient option so that we know which files are being moved.
Find where a symbolic link is pointing: readlink <filename>. ls -l also does the job.
To delete a symbolic link, do: unlink <symlink name>

MATLAB
======
set(gca, 'LooseInset', get(gca,'TightInset')) - makes the figures tight
white: set(gcf,'color','w');
format compact for temporary command line compactness, Home->Preferences->Command window->Numeric Display->Compact-> Apply ok for permanent
Save images as png -> saveas(gcf,'Barchart.png');
whos <datastructure> - Memory usage
bsxfun
Along with clc, clear always delete all user defined paths and add the paths you need on the spot.
Always try to use parfor whereever you can, the same experiment runs in 1/n the time where n is the number of cores.
Define the rules for overwriting or not variables as the output of your program.
figure('units','normalized','outerposition',[0 0 1 1]) - Make figures fullscreen
Clear all is risky because it even clears all breakpoints.
exist('<filename>','file') - Checking if a file exists
Indexing matrices by specific locations - atry = zeros(3,3); atry(sub2ind(size(atry),[1,2,3],[1,2,3])) = 5.0;
Inverting colormaps in matlab: Eg. colormap(flipud(gray))
Matlab on command line: matlab -nodesktop -nosplash
MATLAB command to see how much memory does a variable take - whos
Exporting figures
-----------------
plot(<x>,<y>,'LineWidth',1.5)
set(gcf, 'Color', 'w');
set(gca,'fontWeight','bold');
export_fig <name>.pdf
save <name>.dat atry -ascii
export_fig(names{i},'-pdf'); - When the names are variables from a cell array named names
Close figures with specific numbers - close(i_1,i_2,...). close all figures - close all.
For using multiple axes in subplot just specify the axies you will be using as an array.
export_fig has a great facility of generating the image on transparent background. Example: "export_fig('/tmp/try1','-pdf','-transparent');. It works even for PDFs.
Close matlab editor m-files
---------------------------
com.mathworks.mlservices.MLEditorServices.closeAll
editorservices.closeGroup
e=editorservices.getAll; e.close
Doesn't work in the recent editions
To get a field of a structure using a function: getfield(<objectname>,'object member name')

To save a variable outside while debugging, do - assignin('<workspace name>','<variable name>',<variable value>);

Vim
---
case insensitive search /<word>\c
Opening file in new tab gvim:
In the gvim.desktop desktop file (/usr/share/applications/ for most GNU/Linux systems) look for the "Exec" line. It will probably be like this:
Exec=gvim -f %F
Change the Exec line to:
Exec=gvim -p --remote-tab-silent %F
You may also need to change the StartupNotify value to "false" if it is currently set "true", or your Vim may not respond properly when the file is already open in a tab.
New window -> :vsplit,:hsplit
Moving between windows -> Ctrl+W arrow,
Closing window -> Ctrl+W q.
Command for opening file in a new tab: --remote-tab
"+(p/y/d) for accessing the system clipboard
Block editing: (from https://somethingididnotknow.wordpress.com/2011/04/22/column-block-insertdelete-on-vim/)
move the cursor to the uppermost character (if you’re selecting lines the way down, bottom if you’re going up) before which you want to insert text
enter Visual Block Mode by pressing Ctrl+v (unless you mapped the paste action to it, in which case you probably already know how to column insert)
select the column using the arrow keys
press Shift+i (switching into Insert Mode)
type the text you want to insert (will be displayed only on the first line)
press esc two times
?????
Profit!
For copying to the system buffer use "+y and for pasting from the system buffer use "+p.
I want to use emacs as my defulat text editor because the shortcuts are easier to remember as commands. Starting file in emacs without opening a new instance is difficult as it requires a running server and using emacsclient. I'll just use vim for now and remember the shortcuts.
Vim move to the start of the file - gg, move to the end of the file - G.
Adding same letter <n> times :normal <n>i<letter>
Set line numbers: set number
To skip to a particular line: <linenumber>G or :<linenumber>Ctrl+Return
Find vim swap type of files: find <path> -type f -name "*.sw[klmnop]"
Find and delete vim swap type of files: find <path> -type f -name "*.sw[klmnop]" -delete

Find and delete files
---------------------
find . -name "*<name>*" -type f
find . -name "*<name>*" -type f -delete (This is useful when you want to recursively delete a particular filetype from a directory. rm -r does not work for that purpose.)
Find upto a depth: find . -maxdepth 4 -iname "*<expression>*"
Don't search file in a path( there were some warnings)(From https://askubuntu.com/questions/176010/exclude-some-of-the-find-results): find . ! -path "*<directory name>*" -iname "*<pattern>*"
For finding and deleting directories(and their contents) matching a particular name: find . -type d -name "*<name>*" -exec rm -rf {} +
Proxy to remove C and C++ executables. be careful can delete other files too: find . -type f -not -iname "*.*" -exec rm '{}' \;
Usually bash commands like grep use globbing instead of regexp. The default find command uses globbing. To use regexp specify the option regexp along with posix option for easier regexp as follows:
find . -regextype posix-egrep -regex '<Regular expression>'
But for find if you want to avoid a particular set of files it is much easier to use multiple commands as follows:
find . -type f -not -iname "*.azw" -not -iname "*.mobi" -not -iname "*.pd*" -not -iname "*.txt*"
If we are only interested in the directories one level deep or deeper, the following command is useful:
find . -type d -mindepth 2
locate <filename> also works in a similar way but it is a system level find(I think).
Find files within two dates: find -newerct "10 Aug 2016" ! -newerct "10 Aug 2017" -ls > /tmp/find_output.txt
For modification time search: find -newermt "10 Aug 2016" ! -newermt "10 Aug 2017" -ls > /tmp/find_output.txt

Disabling open window after inserting usb

Add the following to zshrc:
alias ls='ls --color=auto'
alias rm=gvfs-trash : Removed this alias because I want rm to work as it is, instead installed trash-cli using
sudo apt-get install trash-cli, which has command trash <filename>,trash-list,trash-empty. It still doesn't work for my laptop though I think there might be some problem with the trash directory.
Use 'ls -d */' to just list the directories.
Use 'ls -l | egrep -v '^d'' to list only files.
Use 'ls -I "*.py" -I "*.m"' to exclude files with extension py and m.

Update zshrc without logging out - source ~/.zshrc

Add songs directory - :add <Directory path>

Transfer files from android
---------------------------
Apaprt from putting the files online and then downloading them a better way is through usb. But usb doesn't always transfer all kinds of files. Media files are always available for transfer. So if you have a text file you want to transfer, put it in the camera folder, change its extension name to .jpg and now it will be visible in the files to transfer. After transferring change the extension to .txt.

Android
-------
Disable google news on android: Click screen -> settings -> *Disable* Display discover
Delete a page android - Do the pinch gesture, home screens will appear, remove them one by one.
Adding clocks - long tap home screen -> Widgets -> Add multiple cities widget. My mobile: Add digital clocks widget to homescreen, expand the widget.
I'm feeling lucky corner swipe feature - Caused by ES file explorer. Uninstalled it too intrusive.
Duckduckgo on mobile - Visit DDG, Chrome setting, Search engine, recently visited.
Block cookies - Chrome -> site settings, cookies, blocked.
Even after disabling google assitant, mobile was listening to OK GOOGLE, so went to Settings -> App permissions -> Microphone: Disbled Camera and google permissions to microphone.

Open archive manager in xfce for a zip file - thunar ./<name>.zip &

Python
------
type()
range()
for x in range(10):
a[i] = j
print("I am")
print('The value of x is {} and y is {}'.format(x,y))
For checkign python version: print(sys.version)
Symbolic functions in python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
from sympy import Symbol
f1 = lambda x: x**2
xx = Symbol('x');
f1(xx)
f1(xx).diff(xx)
f1(xx).diff(xx).subs(xx,1)
When is a module imported and which do we have to explicitly import??? Because diff, subs seem to be valid even if we don't import the entire sympy.
Another way of defining a symbolic function is just define your symbols and then define the function as an expression using those symbols.
For example if xx,yy,zz are defined symbols then f3 = mp.e**xx-mp.e**yy+zz-3 is a valid function.
For printing symbolic functions simply do print(f3)
Multiple substitutions: f2.subs([(xx,1),(yy,2)])
Printing
~~~~~~~~
To avoid the newline at the end, for python 3, print(<stuff to print>, end=" ")
Memory info
~~~~~~~~~~~
To know the memory location of a particular object, do 'list(map(id, <object name>))'
PDB
~~~
When in debugger, to list all the breakpoints, simply type 'b'.
Breakpoints are placed in files. To specify a filename to place a breakpoint, do 'b <filepath/filename>:<line number>'
To stop code execution at the particular point and enter the debugger, do 'pdb.set_trace()'.

Adding a permission from group (say execute)
chmod g+x <filename>
Deleting a permission from user (say read)
chmod u-r <filename>
Primary protection from deletions:(Remove the write permissions from all, then it will ask you before deleting a write protected file)
chmod ugo-w <filename>

Sorting the space consumed by files: (https://serverfault.com/questions/62411/how-can-i-sort-du-h-output-by-size) du -h | sort -h
To find the space available: df -ha

Foxit pdf reader
----------------
Disable javascript: Tools -> Preferences -> Javascript(uncheck) (Didn't find this in my linux foxit but that's the internet solution)


Bash arithmetic: can be done but is painful. If you want to see the result of 3+4 the quickest way is $((3+4)). Arithmetic operations with variables do not need variables to have $. for example for printing the value of a+3 we just do $((a+3)) not $(($a + 3))
For printing the value of any variable have to do echo. For substituting the value of the variable have to do $<variable name>

Loops bash
----------
While loop example:
x=1
while [ $x -le 5 ]
do
  echo "Welcome $x times"
  x=$(( $x + 1 ))
done

Looping over sub-directories in bash
for dir in ./*/
do
dirn=${dir%*/}
done

for loop, array for for loop, -le flag,

Disable history for a bash session: set +o history

ADB
---
adb shell getprop ro.build.version.serial (I think for the device ID)

Execute commands if file exists linux
-------------------------------------
FILE=/etc/resolv.conf
if test -f "$FILE"; then
    echo "$FILE exist"
fi

OR

FILE=/etc/resolv.conf
if [ -f "$FILE" ]; then
    echo "$FILE exist"
fi

Linux android usb connect
-------------------------
adb devices
adb root
adb shell commands very useful

Processes analyse: htop (with \)

basename <filepath> : This strips the filename of it's filepath. Eg. basename "$(pwd)/atry.txt"
Opening a file read-only: Use cat command.
Creating a text file with your content via command line: echo "atry" > btry.txt

Edit command - edit /tmp/atry.txt, opens up the file in the text editor ex.

Latex
~~~~~
Label for figures comes after the caption.

Execute a time taking command via ssh - Eg. nohup matlab -batch "myscript" (https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/matlabwindows.html#f7-621863-option1optionN)
Nohup gives a lot of problems, I'm going to try screen.
To know whether I'm in a screen or not,
echo $TERM - returns xterm or something similar if a terminal, otherwise just returns a screen.
echo $STY - returns nothing if normal terminal, screen if it's a screen.
screen is an extremely stable command so will use it compared to any other like tmux. Also the notations of screen are very easy to learn.
Packages
~~~~~~~~
subfig -> \subfloat
subcaption -> \begin{subfigure}
The subfig package is usually preferred over subcaption https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/13625/subcaption-vs-subfig-best-package-for-referencing-a-subfigure wherever it works.
IEEE may enforce subfig.

ssh
~~~
To disconnect from an ssh connection, Press Enter, ~, .
To suspend from an ssh session, Press Enter, ~, C-z
Normal characters are forwarded over the ssh session, so we need to use special characters like the above.
Sometimes disconnecting the connection results in termination signal for the program in screen. To avoid that, just suspending the ssh service works.
Sometimes when I try to connect to a screen using screen -r command it says "There is no screen to be resumed matching". This behavior actually results from using multi-display mode. When you detach a screen session on multi-display, it will only detach on the current terminal. In my case it usually happens if the screen was started from another ssh session or terminal which did not detach before the session closed I think. Using -x instead of -r helps.
'echo $TERM && echo $STY && screen -ls' helps to know whether I'm in a screen. For tmux it is 'echo $TERM && echo $STY && tmux ls'
For screen logging use -L option.
To enable scrolling in screen do C-A Esc -> scroll -> q

To crop margins from pdf - pdfcrop --margins '-<left> -<top> -<right> -<bottom>' input.pdf output.pdf. This forcefully crops the margins. pdfcrop input.pdf output.pdf does not forcefully crop the margins.
Briss is an awesome tool to crop margins. Run it using 'java -jar briss-0.9.jar'
