* Conditionals
- Assignment inside if conditional seems difficult. A more straightforward way is that the if conditional will have some value and you will assign it to a variable outside. For example
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
a = if b>0
then 2
else 3
#+END_SRC

* Functions
- Typical syntax of function input and return
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
  f inp_1 inp_2 = output where
  function body
#+END_SRC

* Lists
- Getting the starting element of a list
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
list_0 = head orig_list
#+END_SRC
- Getting the list with the head element stripped
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
list_rest = tail orig_list
#+END_SRC
- List comprehension syntax is like the following
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
a_list = [i | i <- [1..100]]
#+END_SRC
